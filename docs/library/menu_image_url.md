# menu_image_url
## comment

A URL that represents the hamburger icon for mobile devices.
This icon is used to show a set of applicable tools to the user.

You should probably not use this icon on its own, because it has a very reserved meaning.
Instead, consider using "uiHamburgerButton" or, even better, "uiGlobalToolbar"
