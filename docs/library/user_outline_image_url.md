# user_outline_image_url
## comment

A URL that represents the outlined user icon.
This icon is used to tell the user that he or she is logged out.

You should probably not use this icon on its own, because it has a very reserved meaning.
Instead, consider using "uiUserButton" or, even better, "uiGlobalToolbar"
