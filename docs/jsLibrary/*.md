The standard multiply function. It multiplies one number (the first parameter) with another (the second parameter).

Usage example:
```kalzit
print: 2 * 3.
```

The multiply function is an array function, meaning at can be applied to an array of values.
For example, you can use code like this: `2 * 0 to 10`. It produces the even numbers from 0 to 20.
