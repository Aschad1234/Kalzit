The standard division function. It divides one number (the first parameter) by another (the second parameter).

Usage example:
```kalzit
print: 6 % 3.
```

The multiply function is an array function, meaning at can be applied to an array of values.
For example, you can use code like this: `6 % 2;3`. It produces the even numbers 3 and 2.
