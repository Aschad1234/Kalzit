The standard plus function. In the current version, it can have two different effects:

1. When applied with two numbers as its parameter, it returns the sum of them.
2. When applied with two strings as its parameter, it returns the catenated string.
3. If the function is called with something other than a number (and other than `void`) as a parameter, the second case is applied.

The plus function is an array function, meaning at can be applied to an array of values.
For example, if you use the code `2 + 0 to 10`, it produces the numbers from 2 to 12.

Usage example for strings:
```kalzit
print: "Hello " + "World".
```

Usage example for numbers:
```kalzit
print: 2 + 3.
```
