The standard minus function. It subtracts one number (the first parameter) from another (the second parameter).

Usage example:
```kalzit
print: 2 - 3.
```

The minus function is an array function, meaning at can be applied to an array of values.
For example, you can use code like this: `5 - 0 to 10`. It produces the numbers from 5 to -5.
