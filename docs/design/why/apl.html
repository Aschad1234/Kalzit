<h1>Why is it good to be similar to APL?</h1>

<ul>
<li>It has basically no boilerplate code</li>
<li>Once you understand the <a href="/docs/design/why/arrayProgramming.html">array-based</a> concept and the <a href="/docs/design/why/operatorPrecedence.html">right-to-left evaluation</a>, you basically know the language (except the <a href="/docs/api/home">library</a>, which you can easily learn when you need it)</li>
<li>It has very little potential for breaking programs (As far as I know, things like infinite while loops are not possible)</li>
</ul>

<h1>What is bad about the original APL (as a programmer)?</h1>

<ul>
<li>It was not designed for typing, so it contains many weird symbols.</li>
<li>While usually being short, APL code is often hard to understand for someone who does not know the language.</li>
<li>It is not exactly great suited for use on the web or for GUI applications</li>
</ul>

<h1>What does this language do better?</h1>

<ul>
<li>It is designed for the web and able to run on most platforms, because it is implemented in JavaScript</li>
<li>It is rather simple to implement GUIs with it (at least certain kinds), which makes it a compelling option</li>
<li>You can type it with your normal keyboard, and using the symbols you already know</li>
<li>You are probably able to read and sort-of understand most programs written in it, without having to know a thing about the language itself</li>
</ul>
