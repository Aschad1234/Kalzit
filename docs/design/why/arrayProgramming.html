<h1>What is array programming?</h1>

<p>When done correctly, array programming means that you can perform an operation on multiple elements the same way you can with a single one.</p>

<p>For example, you probably know what this code does:</p>

<p><code>
Print: 2 * 5.
</code></p>

<p>Just to be clear, this multiplies <code>2</code> and <code>5</code>, and prints the result (<code>10</code>).
This has nothing to do with array programming yet, but the next example has.</p>

<p>So now we want to multiply many numbers by <code>2</code>. Say all from 1 to 100.
Remember that we can do an operation on multiple elements the same way we can on a single one.
This means we just need to replace the number <code>5</code> (what we want to multiply by <code>2</code>) with the numbers from 1 to 100:</p>

<p><code>
Print: 2 * 1 to 100
</code></p>

<p>And that is it! Now, we are multiplying each number from <code>1 to 100</code> by <code>2</code>, and <code>print</code> the result again - now, the result is a list of all even numbers from 2 to 200.</p>

<h1>Why is array programming useful?</h1>

<ul>
<li>It allows for very short code - no need for loops, counters, temporary lists or other things.</li>
<li>It requires very little maintainance - you do not need to rewrite many things just to support arrays. In other languages, you would need two implementations of the same process.</li>
</ul>

<h1>How can you make use of array programming in this language?</h1>
