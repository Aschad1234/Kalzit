#  Plans for release "4.3"

At the time of writing this (June 6, 2020), 4.3 is the name for the release which will follow [this one](/docs/changelog/2020.06.06.md).

The main point for this release will be to improve speed and to make the project (and the apps created with it) smaller.

The following steps will help to achieve that:

## Remove or rewrite useless, deprecated or broken APIs
Kalzit has been in development for quite a bit of time now, and because of that, many APIs have changed their names, some became broken and so on.
This means that there are many APIs which can be safely removed, because there is no need for them any more.
Because there are not too many people who actively code with Kalzit (if you are doing that, please let me know, thank you), there is also no need to keep old stuff.

The entire point of removing these APIs is not to annoy developers, but it is to make their apps less bloated and faster for the user to run.

## Support the HTTP code 304
The HTTP response 304 means "resource not modified".
It basically tells the browser to use the resource it already downloaded once, rather than downloading it again.
Because this reduces the amount of downloaded data, it will also make Kalzit apps a lot faster.
