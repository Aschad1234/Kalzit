<h1>Basic maths</h1>

<p>I think the basics are most easily explained by examples.
You can try these line-by-line in the <a href="/app/ide">language playground</a>. Please do not paste the entire code into the text field as one thing, because that would not show all results.</p>

<p><code>1 + 2.</code> (Addition)</p>

<p><code>3 * 4.</code> (Multiplication)</p>

<p><code>2 - 7.</code> (Subtraction)</p>

<p><code>6 % 3.</code> (Division)</p>

<p>The results you see should be <code>3</code>, <code>12</code>, <code>-5</code> and <code>2</code>. You have just learned the basic math operations!</p>

<p>Kalzit uses right-to-left evaluation. If you write <code>2 * 1 + 3</code> the result is not <code>5</code> but <code>8</code>. This is because <code>1 + 3</code> is evaluated first (with <code>4</code> as the result), and then <code>2 * 4</code> is <code>8</code>.
