#{
	Returns the ID of the current app.
	If the variable "appId" is set, that is returned.
	Otherwise, the current URL is parsed (expected format is ".../app/appId") and the ID is generated based on that.
	In case none of these methods work, void (empty list) is returned.
	
	Usage example:
		print: !getAppId.
}
$getAppId = () fun {
	!ifElse (appId eq void) {
		second: "/app/([a-zA-Z]+)" match do:dynamicAppUrl
	};{
		appId
	}
}.
