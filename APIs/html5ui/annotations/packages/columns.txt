#{
	An annotation which causes the elements inside of a UI container to be displayed in columns.
	For example, if you have two longer pieces of text, which you want to put side by side, you can do this:
		
		$textA = "First long text".
		$textB = "Second long text".
		print: @(columns 2) uiContainer textA;textB.
		
	The annotation also allows you to specify the number of columns. As an example, you can use @(columns 4) to get four.
	
	If you do not want to specify the column count yourself, or prefer a way which does not use annotations, consider using the "uiColumns" function instead.
