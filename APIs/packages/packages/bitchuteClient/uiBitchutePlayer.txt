#{
	Creates a player for a given BitChute video.
	The video is represented by its ID, which might be obtained by functions like "bitchuteSearchVideoIds".
	
	Additionally, you can specify an optional callback which will be called once the media controller for the video is ready.
	
	Simple usage example:
		print: uiBitchutePlayer: "someVideoId".
	
	Usage example with callback:
		print: "someVideoId" uiBitchutePlayer $_video fun {
			`Just start playing the video`
			play _video
		}
}
$uiBitchutePlayer = ($id ? String ; $callback) fun {(bitchuteVideoFileUrl: id) uiVideoPlayer callback}
