#{
	Returns the file extension from a given file path.
	That is done by simply returning whatever is behind the last dot.
	
	The following would return "txt":
	fileExtension: "path/test.txt".
	
	If you write something else, however, the result could make less sense:
	fileExtension: "https://www.github.com". `Result is the string "com"`
	
	In case there is no dot, the entire string is returned:
	fileExtension: "jpg". `Still jpg`
