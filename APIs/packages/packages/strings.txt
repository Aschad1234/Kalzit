#{
	A function which gives you easy access to the global string library, which provides a few standard texts (but not many right now).
	
	For example, you can get a text saying something meaning "Accept cookies" - if available in the user's language:
		print: strings: $cookieAcceptText.
}
$strings = do: localizedStringAssetAccess.
