#{
	Provides a simple way to add flag annotations to a value.
	
	Flag annotations are a special kind of annotations, which are marked by the "flag" key.
	This kind of annotation does have an intended side effect.
	
	For example, if you write this:
	@(flag: "onHover";{print: "Test"}) uiText: "My text".
	You will cause "Test" to be printed every time the mouse hovers over the text element.
	
	If you want to create your own flag, you could do this:
	$flagMyCustom = !fun ($text ; $_annotatedValue) {print text. print _annotatedValue}.
	
	Then you could use it like that:
	@(flag: "myCustom";"A text") "Something else".
	That will cause two lines of text to be printed:
		
	A text
	Something else
