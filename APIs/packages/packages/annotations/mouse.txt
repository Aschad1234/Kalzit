#{
	An annotation that adds a function to a UI element which is triggered when the mouse hovers it.
	
	Example:
	@(onHover {popupMessage: "Hovered"}) uiText: "Stuff".
}
$onHover = $listener fun {flag: ["onHover"];[listener]}.

#{
	An annotation that adds a function to a UI element when the user taps it.
	That means either the click of a mouse or the tap of a finger on a touch screen.
	
	Example:
	@(onTap {popupMessage: "Tapped"}) uiText: "Stuff".
}
$onTap = $listener fun {flag: ["onTap"];[listener]}.

#{
	An annotation that adds a function to a UI element when the user pointer goes down.
	That means either the press (and hold) of a mouse or of a finger on a touch screen.
	
	Example:
	@(onPointerDown {popupMessage: "Pointer down"}) uiText: "Stuff".
	
	This is different from @onTap because the function is triggered before the user releases the mouse button, for example.
}
$onPointerDown = $listener fun {flag: ["onPointerDown"];[listener]}.

#{
	An annotation that adds a function to a UI element when the user pointer goes up.
	That means either the release of the main mouse button or of a finger on a touch screen.
	
	Example:
	@(onPointerUp {popupMessage: "Pointer up"}) uiText: "Stuff".
	
	This is different from @onTap because it also triggers the event when the mouse button was pressed anywhere else, but released over the UI element.
}
$onPointerUp = $listener fun {flag: ["onPointerUp"];[listener]}.

#{
	An annotation that adds a function to a UI element when the user pointer moves and ends up over the element.
	That means either the movement of a mouse cursor or of a finger on a touch screen.
	
	Example:
	@(onPointerMove {popupMessage: "Pointer move"}) uiText: "Stuff".
	
	The event can be triggered very frequently, so the associated function should never take a long time to run.
	If you want to figure out if the pointer is over an element, use @onHover instead.
}
$onPointerMove = $listener fun {flag: ["onPointerMove"];[listener]}.
